I. Key Concepts
Language Models & ChatGPT: Predict next tokens (characters/words) using transformer architecture.
Transformers: Use self-attention to process sequential data; introduced in "Attention is All You Need" (2017).
Character-Level Models: Treat individual characters as tokens, suitable for smaller datasets like the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
Tokenization & Encoding: Convert text into numerical representations for processing.
II. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Map characters to integers.
Splitting Dataset: Train/validation split (90/10%).
III. Transformer Basics
Block Size: Defines the context length for predictions.
Batch Processing: Enables parallelization for GPU efficiency.
IV. Bigram Language Model
Considers the previous character for predictions.
Serves as a simple foundation before implementing transformers.
V. Self-Attention Mechanics
Averaging Embeddings: Simplifies context representation.
Matrix Multiplication Trick: Efficiently calculates weighted averages of prior tokens.
VI. Building the Transformer
Positional Embeddings: Add sequence position information.
Self-Attention: Computes relationships using keys, queries, and values.
Multi-Head Attention: Captures diverse token relationships.
Feedforward Network: Applies transformations for feature learning.
VII. Optimizing Deep Networks
Residual Connections: Prevent gradient vanishing.
Layer Normalization: Stabilizes training by normalizing features.
VIII. Scaling & Results
Larger Models: Increase dimensions, layers, and use dropout for regularization.
Evaluation: Improved validation loss and coherence in generated text.
IX. From nanoGPT to ChatGPT
nanoGPT: A decoder-only transformer for text generation.
ChatGPT: Fine-tunes GPT with supervised learning and reinforcement techniques for conversational tasks.
X. nanoGPT Codebase
Key Files: bigram.py for training logic, gpt.py for architecture.
